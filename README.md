### Hi fellow ðŸ‘‹

I'm Carlos PÃ©rez Cerrato an experienced developer and DevOps, I like pretty much to think about solve problems and strive to get the optimal solution. I'm a strong advocate of KISS and YAGNI. I like to learn new things (in general). I'm always reading about OOP, software architectures and testing.

Most part of the time I worked for companies in private repositories specially those ones related with development. 

I have a couple public repositories mostly related with my devops/sysadmin jobs. Be feel free to explore and pick or copy whatever you need.
