### Hi fellow ðŸ‘‹

I'm Carlos an experienced developer and DevOps, I like pretty much to think about solve problems and strive to get the optimal solution. I'm a strong advocate of KISS and YAGNI. I like to learn new things (in general). I'm always reading about OOP, software architectures and testing.

Most part of the time I worked for companies in private repositories specially those ones related with development. 

I have a couple public repositories mostly related with my devops/sysadmin jobs. Be feel free to explore and pick or copy whatever you need.


#### DevOps bits ðŸš€

Here are some of projects I created and shared with the community:

* **Bash script** to find **MySQL** queries by patterns, execution time, or both and kill them **without restarting** MySQL: [mysql-kill-query](https://github.com/cpcerrato/mysql-kill-query).
* **Bash script** to manipulate **MySQL** dumps and extract databases or tables you want to restore: [mysqldump-extract](https://github.com/cpcerrato/mysqldump-extract).

* **Bash script** to manage **Postfix** queues: [pfqueues](https://github.com/cpcerrato/pfqueues).
* **Bash script** to extract information about **CDIR**. [cdir2ip](https://github.com/cpcerrato/cdir2ips).

* **Docker image** to create ssh tunnels: [docker-autossh](https://github.com/cpcerrato/docker-autossh).
